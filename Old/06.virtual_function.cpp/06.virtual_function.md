# Virtual_Function

Understand the virtual function before understand the override. Override mean a member function override the derived function from base. Here this chapter table of content :

## Override

If base pointer store derived pointer and both class has same member function then base member function will override the derived member function. It call override. Here example :

**_Program : base_pointer_**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// create class
class Base{
    public :
        void message(void){
            cout << "This is message from base" << endl;
        }
};

class Derived:public Base{
    public :
        void message(void){
            cout << "This is messgae from derived" << endl;
        }
};

int main(void){
    Base *base_pointer;
    Derived derived_object;
    base_pointer = &derived_object;

    cout << "base_pointer store derived object now " << endl;
    cout << "see which member function base pointer called : " << endl;
    base_pointer->message();
    return 0;
}
```

**_Output : base pointer_**

```
base_pointer store derived object now
see which member function base pointer called :
This is message from base
```

That's why use virtual function. Syntax of virtual function :

```cpp
virtual return_type function_name(parameter_list);
```

We can not declear virtual function as stand alone function.If class has virtual function that's class called polymorphic class. Base class virtual function will override by derived class function. Here example :

**_Program : virtual function_**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// create base class
class Base{
    public :
        virtual void Message(void){
            cout << "Virtual : It's Base class" << endl;
        }

        void non_virtual_message(void){
            cout << "non virtual : It's Base class" << endl;
        }
};

class Derived:public Base{
    public :
    void Message(void){
        cout << "It'Derived Class" << endl;
    }

    void non_virtual_message(void){
            cout << "non virtual : It's derived class" << endl;
        }
};


int main(void){
    // create base
    Base *base_pointer;

    Derived derived;

    base_pointer = &derived;

    cout << "Derived.Message() : " << endl;
    derived.Message();
    cout << "Derived.non_virtual_message() : " << endl;
    derived.non_virtual_message();

    cout <<"\nbase_pinter point derived class" << endl;
    cout << "Now base_pointer->Message() : " << endl;
    base_pointer->Message();
    cout << "base_pointer->non_virtual_message() : " << endl;
    base_pointer->non_virtual_message();

    return 0;
}
```

**_Output : virtual function_**

```
Derived.Message() :
It'Derived Class
Derived.non_virtual_message() :
non virtual : It's derived class

base_pinter point derived class
Now base_pointer->Message() :
It'Derived Class
base_pointer->non_virtual_message() :
non virtual : It's Base class
```

## Binding

A realeasion between call the function and start to execute the function code called binding. Here two type of bind in c++ :

1. Early Binding or Static Binding.
1. Late Binding or dynamic Binding.

### Early Binding or Static Binding

In c++ when we called normal function, overloaded function or friend and virtual function then program compiler figure out the function address compile time. That's means complate the binding work compile time. That's why it called **_early binding._**

### Dynamic Binding or Late Binding

compiler can not figure out the function address when called base class virtual function by pointer object. Because pointer object point which one it can not figure out compile time. That why this term work program run time. Virtual function bind starting start program run time.It's called **_Late binding or Dynamic Binding_**

## virtual function constructor and destructor

We can not declear constructor but we can declear virtual destructor. If we declear a destructor as a virtual then first called derived class destructor then called base destructor function called.

**_Program : virtual destructor_**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// create class
class Base{
    public :
    virtual ~Base(void){
            cout << "This is base destructor. virtual." << endl;
        }
};

class Derived:public Base{
    public :
        ~Derived(void){
            cout << "This is derived destructor." << endl;
        }
};

int main(void){
    Base *base_pointer;
    base_pointer = new Derived;
    // finish the function and see which destructo first called
    delete base_pointer;
    return 0;
}
```

**_Output : virtual destructor_**

```
This is derived destructor.
This is base destructor. virtual.
```

## pure virtual function and destructor

Pure virtual funciton mean inform the compiler that it is virtual function and this function defination will write in derived class not in base class. we also declear virtual destructor but in that case we must write definatin in base class.A class with pure virtual function then we can not create this class normal object but create pointer. Here example :

syntax to declear pure virtual function and destructor :

```cpp
class Base{
    public :
        virtual return_type function_name(parameter_list) = 0;
        virtual ~Base(void);
};

Base::~Base(void){
    // defination here..................
}
```

If a class with atleast one virtual function that call **_abstract_** class.

**_Program : pure virtual function and destructor_**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// create Base class
class Base{
    public :
        virtual void msg(void) = 0;
        virtual ~Base(void) = 0;
};

Base::~Base(void){
    cout << "this is virtual base destructor." << endl; ;
}

class Derived:public Base{
    public :
        void msg(void);
        ~Derived(void){
            cout << "This is derived destructor." << endl;
        }
};

void Derived::msg(void){
    cout << "This is derived msg" << endl;
}

int main(void){
    // create base ponter and delete it
    Base *base_pointer = new Derived;

    base_pointer->msg();
    delete base_pointer;

    return 0;
}
```

**_Output : pure virtual function and destructor_**

```
This is derived msg
This is derived destructor.
this is virtual base destructor.
```
