Principle of Object Oriented Programming
========================================

The basic concept of object oriented programm is : 

1. Objects
2. Classes
3. Data Abstruction and encapsulation
4. Inheritance
5. Polymorphism 
6. Dynamic Binding
7. Message Passing

## Object 
Object are the basic run-time entities in an object-oriented system. They represent data, attribute or properties of something. 

> ðŸ“’ Object is a entities which is represent data, attribute or properties of something.

Here simple example in diagram where considered that Person is object : 
![Person Object](./../asset/diagram/object%20example.png)

## Classes
Class is a prototype of a function. We created object by class. another word a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object. 

> ðŸ“’ a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object . 

## Data Abstraction and Encapsulation
The wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit (called class) is known as **encapsulation.** The data is not accessible to the outside of the world. **Abstraction** refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or  explanations. 

> ðŸ“’ Since the classes use the concept of data abstraction, they are known as **Abstract Data Types (ADT).**

## Inheritance 
Inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of objects of another class. It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. In OOP, the concept of inheritance provides the idea of resuability. This means that we can add additional features to an existing class without modifying it. 

> ðŸ“’ When a class derives from another calls called inheritance in oop.

## Polymorphism 
Polymorphism, a Greek term, means **the ability ot take more than one form.** Polymorphism in oop is, an operation may exhibit different behaviors in different instances. 

> ðŸ“’ Using a single function name to perform different types of tasks is known as function overloading.

## Dynamic Binding 
Dynamic binding (also known as late biding) means that the code associated with a given procedure call is not known until the time of the call at run time. It is associated with Polymorphism and inheritance. A function call associated with a polymorphic reference depends on the dynamic type of that reference.

## Message Passing 
Objects communicate with one another by sending and receving information much the same way as people pass messages to one another. The concept of message passing makes it easier to talk about building systems that directly model or simulate their real-world counterparts.

> ðŸ“’ Object communicate with one another by sending and receving data, this conncept called **Message Passing**.
